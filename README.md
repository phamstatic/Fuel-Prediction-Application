# Instructions on React Development
Written by John for Windows users only ðŸ’€ <br>
Prerequisites: Windows Subsystem for Linux (Ubuntu) and Visual Studio Code.

### Installing Node.js
> We're gonna need Node.js to be able to use React <br>
Using the Linux terminal, 
```bash
sudo apt-get install curl # Need this to be able to install Node.js
nvm install --lts # Installs Node.js

node -v # Should be v18.18.0

# You'll also need to download these frameworks for multi-page navigation.
npm install react-router-dom 
npm install --save styled-components
```
### Beginning React Development
Fetch the repository (git fetch) or clone (git clone https://github.com/phamstatic/Fuel-Prediction-Application/) into a new folder.

Open the front-end folder and type in the console: **npm install** <br>
> This is needed because our .gitignore file does not save the modules into our repository. Using npm install will give you the required dependencies and packages to make React work.

To begin hosting the app, run **npm start**
> Now the application should be on a local port running on the browser. Any change/edit done will be updated automatically.
